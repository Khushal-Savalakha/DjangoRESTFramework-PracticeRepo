## üìú Introduction

This repository is a collection of **practice projects** aimed at mastering **Django REST Framework (DRF)**. It covers essential concepts and provides real-world examples for:
- Serialization/Deserialization
- Function-Based Views (FBVs)
- Class-Based Views (CBVs)
- API Views
- Mixins
- Session Management
- JWT Token Integration

> **Note**:  
Before diving into Django REST Framework, it is essential to have a foundational understanding of **Django**. You can refer to my [Django-Practice-Projects](https://github.com/Khushal-Savalakha/Django-Practice-Projects) repository, where basic Django concepts are covered.

For those short on time, learning up to **gs12** (Class-Based API Views) in this repository will be sufficient to build basic-level projects. Check out my project [CineView-Secure-Movie-Booking](https://github.com/Khushal-Savalakha/CineView-Secure-Movie-Booking), which integrates technologies like:
- Payment integration
- Booking history
- Real-time booking updates  
Using **Tailwind CSS**, **React**, **Django REST Framework**, **Express.js**, and **Stripe** for payment processing.
